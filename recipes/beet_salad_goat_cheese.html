        This delicious beet salad with creamy goat cheese, maple-candied walnuts, and a tangy orange and balsamic
        vinaigrette is a beautiful way to serve beets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beet salad pairs perfectly with hearty dishes like roasted pork loin or mushroom risotto. Try a tasty lentil
        burger for a plant-based dinner with mass appeal.

        As the beets cook, toast the walnuts and stir in the maple syrup. Whisk together the orange juice concentrate,
        olive oil, and balsamic vinegar to make the dressing.

        Divide the ingredients equally among servings. Top with goat cheese and drizzle with dressing for a luscious
        finish.

    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place beets into a saucepan; add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then cook for 20 to 30 minutes,
            until tender. Drain and cool, then cut into cubes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While beets are cooking, place walnuts in a skillet over medium-low heat. Heat until warm and starting to
            toast. Stir in maple syrup; cook and stir until evenly coated, then remove from heat and set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the dressing: Whisk orange juice concentrate, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil together in a small
            bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a large helping of baby greens onto each of four salad plates, divide candied walnuts equally and
            sprinkle over greens. Place equal amounts of beets over greens and top with pieces of goat cheese. Drizzle
            dressing over each salad.
